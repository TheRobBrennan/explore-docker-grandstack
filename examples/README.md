# Welcome

This example is based off the original [GRANDstack Starter](https://grandstack.io/docs/getting-started-grand-stack-starter.html)

## Getting started

The easiest way to get started with the GRANDstack is to clone the [GRANDstack Starter](https://grandstack.io/docs/getting-started-grand-stack-starter.html):

```sh
# Make sure you're in the examples folder
$ cd examples

# Clone the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/grand-stack/grand-stack-starter.git grandstack-example

# Remove git history so we can track it in this repo instead of against the original source repo
$ cd grandstack-example
$ rm -rf .git
```
